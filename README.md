# web-scraping
Repository containing some of my web scraper programs. These programs are written in Python and utilize the BeautifulSoup and pandas libraries.

## penn_cities
This program scrapes data from Wikipedia about cities in Pennsylvania. I cleaned the data using pandas before exporting it as a singular CSV (penn_cities.csv).

## world_pops
This program scrapes data from the World Bank about the populations of different countries. I cleaned the data using pandas, and split it to be exported as two CSVs: pops_bycountry.csv and pops_summary.csv.
